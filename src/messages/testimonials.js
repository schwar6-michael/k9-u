      "I sent my 8 month old puppy to Marlon and she came back a different dog, in the best way possible. Marlon and I were in constant communication about my priorities for the training and he continuously sent me videos and updates while she was away. Upon her return, he spent a few hours reviewing everything with me and making sure I felt comfortable going forward. Ruby is now able to walk by my side without ever pulling, and she responds immediately to other commands such as off, sit and stay.  I am so glad I sent her and look forward to using Marlon’s other services in the future!",

      "Marlon changed my life. Having a dog like Hanq in a smaller, New York apartment was incredibly challenging. However, in just two weeks Marlon was able to change that. Hanq responds to my every command, never pulls on the leash, and never eats from the table. I have no doubt in my mind that Marlon can help and train any dog out there. Thanks again, Marlon!",

      "Marlon is an amazing trainer who really took the time to not only train my golden doodle Duncan, but teach me as well! He equip me with the proper tools to establish good behavior habits within Duncan on day one. I started training almost immediately after Duncan settled into my home, at only a couple months old. Marlon made himself available at any time of day, whether it be to assist me with questions or provide me with any additional help. I knew I could depend on Marlon and even trusted him with a key to my home to visit Duncan on my 13-hour work days. Marlon is a very passionate, driven, and genuine person who always provided a positive attitude even when I would get frustrated with silly puppy antics. Now 5 years later, Duncan and I continue to use Marlon as a valuable resource; most recently to introduce my boyfriend’s dominant male dog with Duncan. I’m thankful for his dedication to help me achieve my goal of having a dog I can confidently let off leash in any situation. It was worth every penny to know that my dog was safe and happy every step of the way. Thanks uncle Marlon!",

      "Marlon has been caring for our mini golden doodle Reggie for over 2 years.  We first sent Reggie to Marlon’s 2 week training program when she was 5 months old.  As a busy family with young children, we were struggling with the time and consistency needed to make training successful.  Marlon took the stress, frustration, and guesswork out of training and made it an enjoyable experience both for Reggie and for us.  Marlon also taught us the commands and skills that Reggie had learned and has been available for questions and follow up as needed. Marlon helped us go from feeling overwhelmed by our puppy to feeling overjoyed to have her in our family.  It was the best choice we made, both for ourselves and for Reggie! ",

      "Marlon is an amazing trainer and has become a member of our family. He is confident, calm, an expert and clearly loves dogs. He has helped make me more confident as well. When we first got our mini schnauzer from rural Utah, she was shell shocked and in rough physical shape. A friend recommended him strongly and a little nervously we sent her to Marlon a 4 week board and train. For a month, Marlon slowly acclimated her to city living, other dogs, gaining confidence and mastering her basic commands. He also took care of her, getting her groomed, brushing her and making her feel comfortable. It was one of our best decisions.When we got her back, she was more much comfortable and able to adapt to her new life. We continued with training with Marlon, maintaining the strong foundation he established. Grayson loves him and also did agility training with him, which went great. We board her with Marlon during vacations and holidays. It is her second home.  People compliment me all the time on my dog’s temperament and sweet nature. She is well trained and happy and I give Marlon most of the credit!",

      "Marlon not only trained both my dogs, he gave me my life back, as well as my sanity. Rewind to 3 years ago and I had an aggressive, barking, alpha 7lbs shihtzu that “thought” she ruled the house. It was horrible to walk her, constantly pulling on the leash, did not listen to any commands, and would bark at everything that walked by her or the house. It got to the point where my husband and I couldn’t take it anymore and I found our savior, Marlon. ",
