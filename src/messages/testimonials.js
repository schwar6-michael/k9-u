      "Marlon not only trained both my dogs, he gave me my life back, as well as my sanity. Rewind to 3 years ago and I had an aggressive, barking, alpha 7lbs shihtzu that “thought” she ruled the house. It was horrible to walk her, constantly pulling on the leash, did not listen to any commands, and would bark at everything that walked by her or the house. It got to the point where my husband and I couldn’t take it anymore and I found our savior, Marlon. Dixie, is our baby, yes, I’ll be the first to say we spoil her and treat her as if she is our child, which is mainly the reason why she acted the way she did, a pure stubborn diva. Once being introduced to Marlon I was VERY skeptical because, well, I’ve wasted so much money on training so many times for Dixie, I had zero hope, I thought because she was 3 years old and so “bad” that she wasn’t trainable. After meeting with Marlon my husband and I decided to go with the 2 week boarding. Not only was I a nervous wreck because I didn’t think Dixie would be able to be trained, but now I wasn’t seeing her for two weeks!! Marlon was incredible with keeping us up to date with pictures and videos to ease my anxiety of her being away for two weeks. I’ll never forget when I got the first video of her listening to the command “down” I honestly couldn’t believe it, because to get Dixie to even make eye contact with you, was a challenge. The two weeks flew by, and my husband and I met Marlon at a local park. Dixie was laying by his feet, OFF LEASH! I walked up and said, “Marlon! Put her on a leash! There is a dog coming!!!” He laughed, and Dixie just laid there, and wasn’t even phased by the dog passing. I almost fell over because I was amazed at how well she was behaving. Then he gave her a command, “heel” and started walking. Wait?! What?! My dog was following Marlon, glued to his side! He was doing figure 8’s etc. if he stopped walking, she stopped walking. I couldn’t believe my eyes....we went over everything, from top to bottom. It was a great pick up session, as Matthew (my husband) and I were taught all the commands as well. Fast forward 3 years and Dixie is unbelievable, many people have asked me how she is so well trained (it’s also kinda cool because my dog listens so well and can “sit” and “down” from a football field away) so it’s definitely a conversation starter at dog friendly breweries! I can walk her, on/off leash with no problem, I can give her all commands, sit, down, break, place, come... she doesn’t bark anymore, and most importantly, isn’t aggressive anymore. We recently got another shihtzu and of course, I called Marlon right away for training. I can easily say, I have the best trained dogs out of everyone I know (haha) Marlon is not just a “dog trainer” he is such an unbelievable person that treats your dogs as if they were his. I have zero hesitation when I go away, because I know my dogs are in great hands. I will tell you, if you’re hesitant about the training, don’t be. There isn’t one negative thing I can say about any of the training/outcomes. It was the best money I’ve ever spent, I will never stop recommending Marlon, he really is the, dog whisperer. 10 out of 5 stars. Truly incredible results! ",
